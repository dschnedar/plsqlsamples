PL/SQL Samples



This is just a small set of PL/SQL practice code that I pulled off a hardrive.

  Some are examples of Oracle features that many blogs cover. 

  Others are small classical homework problems that would be done to learn a concept or to practice coding.

  PL/SQL is far more mature than most SQL based procedural languages. 
  In T-SQL and PL/pgSQL there are no native objects like arrays/hashes/dictionaries.
  These features can't be replicatid in T-SQL and PL/pgSQL without using database tables.

Features of PL/SQL: 
  SQL tunning, 
  DBMS_ASERT (SQL injection filter), 
  aggregate function to find max_prime number ( like SUM() or MAX() ),
  nested tables,
  finding constraints,
  stack data type,
  rollup cube pivot,
  conditional compilation
  ...
  

Algorithms not focused on the database or PL/SQL in particular: 
  Sudoku solver, 
  Conway's Game of Life, 
  finding prime numbers, 
  hex to decimal conversion, 
  othello or reversi, 
  finding prime numbers,
  stack,
  octal/hexidecimal/decimal converter
