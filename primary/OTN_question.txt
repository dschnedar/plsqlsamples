SQL*Plus Error?:
It appears that the parser does not like "--" at then end of the first line of the query.
I see this error "ORA-00936: missing expression" or "ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended"
SQL*Plus does not number the 2nd line when I do this.
If a space follows the --, "-- ", I still get the error.
a single "-" at the end of the line is ignored, and the query works
But, "--." will not get the error.
I believe that I have had this problem before inside the middle of a PL/SQL package procedure.

This is obviously easy to avoid.  Is this just a quirk or am I missing something?
